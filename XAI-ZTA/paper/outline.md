# XAI-ZTA: Explainable AI for Zero Trust Continuous Authentication Decisions

## IEEE Paper Outline

### Abstract
- Problem: Zero Trust Architecture requires continuous authentication decisions, but ML-based decisions lack transparency
- Approach: Apply SHAP, LIME, and Anchor explanations to Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network classifiers
- Contribution: Novel XAI evaluation framework (faithfulness, stability, sparsity, comprehensibility, latency)
- Results: [TODO: Fill with actual results]

### I. Introduction
- Rise of Zero Trust Architecture (NIST SP 800-207)
- Need for ML in continuous authentication
- Gap: Lack of explainability in automated access decisions
- Research questions:
  1. How effectively can XAI methods explain ZTA authentication decisions?
  2. Which XAI method best balances explanation quality and real-time performance?
  3. Do explanations improve security analyst trust and decision-making?
